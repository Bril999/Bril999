### :man_technologist: About me:

I am a novice developer. My path to it began with the Bauman Moscow State Technical University, where I first learned in detail about programming in Python using HTML, CSS, Flask, SQL, which is where I started my path in web programming. I also studied the C language, in which I wrote several serious projects (print test, database, graph handler) using tools such as CJSON, Ncurses, Graphviz. All projects of this subject can be viewed in my profile.
